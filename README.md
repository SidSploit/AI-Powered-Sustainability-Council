# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/18yEl1POIXvmaqIq2VLfNTW38u2cLRmdD

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
   (Vite only exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_` to the browser.)
   
   **Security note:** any `VITE_` key is bundled into the client and is **not secret**. For production, move Gemini calls to a backend/serverless function and keep the key server-side.
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
